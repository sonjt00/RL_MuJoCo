Reinforcement Learning Term Project

Solved the MuJoCo environments.
- Hopper
- Walker
- Half_Cheetah

Solved all the environments with TD3 Algorithm
TD3 does Twin & Double learning.
Twin Learning --> Double Q learning addresses the maximization bias
Delayed Learning --> Actor is less frequently updated than Critic.

Therefore, TD3 was much more stable than DDPG.
